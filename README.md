# Asteroids
A homage to the arcade classic Asteroids, this project encompasses the design and implementation of Atari Asteroids using the Unity game engine.

Some features of the arcade game were improved
- Particle effects were used to provide immersive graphics
- Colour palettes change every few rounds, promoting variety

Others maintained to preserve original experience:
- Retro game sprites were designed for a pixelated look
- Game sound effects were handpicked from 8-bit soundboards
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses
- Replay value is increased with the highscore system

Classic arcade game was used as blueprint for:
- Game mechanics
- A.I. behaviour
- Game difficulty

Whereas a personal touch was added in regards to:
- Game graphics
- Sound effects and in-game music
